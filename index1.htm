      <h3>Voronoi Graph of Points and Line Segments</h3>

      <p>One of my favorite natural patterns is the Voronoi pattern. The Voronoi pattern can be interpreted as a graph, whose edges delineate regions of space that contain Voronoi sites. I am fascinated by the Voronoi pattern and its persistent appearance in natural objects, such as the circulatory system of plants and animals, the cosmic web, living and non-living materials at microscopic scales, seashells, spider webs, trees, nerve cells, etc.</p>

      <p>My curiosity and love of art, nature, and mathematics motivated me to create a simple algorithm to compute the Voronoi graph of an arbitrary set of points and line segments. The algorithm I designed is an alternative to existing algorithms, and it only requires mathematical formulas for the Delaunay triangulation of points. This algorithm can also be extended to approximate the Voronoi graph of any differentiable curve</p>

      <p>The PDF paper below provides a detailed explanation of my algorithm with descriptive images. There is also a link to the GitHub repository that contains the Octave functions and scripts that I created to program this algorithm.</p>
