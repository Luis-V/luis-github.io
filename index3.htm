      <h2>A mechanism to produce a gas with a specified oxygen concentration by mixing</h2>

      <p>At the end of September of 2013, I joined the Biological Microsystems Lab at the University of Illinois at Chicago, directed by Dr. Eddington. I stayed in the Biological Microsystems Lab for about 2 months. During that time, I was asked to devise a mechanism that could combine gases from different tanks of known oxygen concentrations to produce a mixture with a specified oxygen concentration. The mechanism I devised uses a computer to control the flow of the gases from the input tanks in a pattern that determines the oxygen concentration of the resulting mixture of the input gases. The valves are controlled to enforce a high-frequency pulsatile flow from the input tanks.</p>

      <p>The mathematical details of the mechanism I devised are described in the PDF paper below.</p>
