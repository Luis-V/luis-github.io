      <h3>A method to create 3D printable objects from digital wireframes</h3>

      <p>Transforming 3-D models of line segment wireframes into solid trusses is a popular practice in additive manufacturing for rapid prototyping due to reduced material costs. Trusses are also relevant in different areas of mechanical engineering, art, and architecture, and their visualization and mechanical simulation are facilitated by computerized mesh representations.</p>

      <p> I was personally motivated by the prospect of visualizing and 3D printing wireframe-based trusses with intricate geometries whose design is only feasible with a pre-programmed algorithm. Therefore, I created a process to add volume to 3-D wireframes that can cope with any wireframe geometry, including geometries with intersecting wires. The process I devised can produce a polyhedral structure even if the diameter of the beams exceeds a size that enables the resolution of individual beams. </p>

      <p>The PDF paper below provides a more detailed explanation of my algorithm with descriptive images. There is also a link to the GitHub repository that contains the Octave functions and scripts that I created to program this algorithm. </p>

      <p>You can also see examples of trusses I created with this process below. I copied the seahorse wireframe by hand in Blender from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MG86yA9FRM0" target="_blank">this youtube video</a>. The seashell wireframes were extracted from the Voronoi graphs of helical spirals inside of spheres.</p>
